    <h3>Welcome, Parents!</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            CLI Engage is a new online platform that provides free access to classroom tools and resources that have been proven to improve instructional practices in pre-k teachers – allowing these teachers to provide a better classroom environment and specialized instruction to meet the individual needs of children.  These resources were originally developed for teachers participating in the Texas School Ready! Project, a comprehensive professional development program for preschool teachers that provides tools and resources to help these teachers be better teachers.  For over ten years, the Texas School Ready! Project has supporting teachers towards our common goal of improving school readiness for young children in Texas.  Through CLI Engage, pre-k and Head Start teachers in Texas will have access to tools and resources that will help them become better teachers, as well as help your children be more prepared for kindergarten and beyond.

    <h3>How to Access Your Child’s Progress Monitoring Results</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            If your child’s teacher is enrolled in CLI Engage, you will receive a flyer with information on accessing your child’s progress monitoring results.  You can review this information to help you learn about your child’s progress during the course of the school year.  These progress monitoring results are used by your child’s teacher to help plan instruction and meet the specific needs of the children in each class.  Through CLI Engage, your child’s teacher has access to classroom activities that can be used by teachers to build children’s knowledge and skills in key school readiness areas – all helping children be more prepared for kindergarten and later grades.

            Ready to view your child’s progress monitoring results?
        </p>
        <p>
            On the flyer you received from your child’s teacher, you should see your child’s name and log-in information to access your child’s progress monitoring results.  This log-in information is specific to your child’s results – no one else will be able to see your child’s results.  Click the button below to enter your login information.  You will be asked to enter a Google ID – you may use any Google ID (such as a Gmail address) to login.  After you log in the first time, you can use this same Google ID to view your child’s results at any time.

                <div class="panel-body">TSR’s child progress monitoring program, the CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System (formerly known as C-PALLS+), is a user-friendly, technology-driven tool that enables the teacher to assess a child’s progress in a particular skill area almost instantly. This simplistic yet reliable data collection prompts teachers to focus on lessons that target their students’ least developed skill areas.  The child progress monitoring is conducted three times a year, at the beginning, middle, and end of the year.  Teachers are able to use the child progress monitoring results to plan instruction in the classroom and help identify children who may need additional support from the teacher.  Additionally, teachers have access to a wealth of classroom activities that were written to support children in key school readiness areas, including language, vocabulary, and math.</div>

Language, literacy, social emotional skills, mathematics, and science are the core concepts covered in CIRCLE activities. The activities incorporate a gradual release model, wherein a teacher models, demonstrates, and “thinks aloud” so that children understand the concepts behind what the teacher is modeling. Children then practice the skills or concepts with the teacher’s guidance. The updated collection includes new and expanded activities, videos of select activities performed in real classrooms, and direct links to activities from CLI’s child progress monitoring program, the CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System.</div>

        <h3>TSR Parent Literacy Bag</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Parents are a child's first and most important teacher and  the single most influential factor in his or her development. Research tells us  that children are more likely to be on grade level when entering school if they  have parents who read to them on a regular basis, beginning in early childhood.  This type of responsive parenting also leads to healthy relationships for  children as they get older.<br />
                In order to help parents positively affect their child&rsquo;s  cognitive and social development, the Children&rsquo;s Learning Institute created TSR  Parent Bags for parents of Texas prekindergarten students. The materials and  handbook of literacy and math activities included in the TSR Parent Bag will  help parents work with their child at home.   As parents and their children have fun doing these activities together,  it creates a home learning environment for their children that promotes talking  and encourages writing.
