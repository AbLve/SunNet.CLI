        CLI Engage is a comprehensive professional development and progress monitoring platform for pre-k teachers in Texas public schools, charter schools, and Head Start programs. CLI Engage offers free access to professional development and child progress monitoring tools and resources originally developed for use with preschool teachers participating in the Texas School Ready! Project (TSR).  Developed by the Children’s Learning Institute at UTHealth and supported with funding from the Texas Education Agency, TSR tools and resources are available for free to all pre-k teachers in Texas public schools and Head Start programs through the CLI Engage platform.

    <h3>History of CLI Engage</h3>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/tsrlogo.png" alt="about_us_ipc">
        <p>
            For over ten years, the Children’s Learning Institute has managed the implementation and ongoing enhancement of the Texas School Ready! (TSR) Project—a data-driven, comprehensive professional development and child progress monitoring program aimed at increasing school readiness skills in at-risk students.  Since 2003, more than 25,000 preschool teachers in a variety of settings have participated in TSR – positively impacting the quality of instruction and classroom environment of more than 380,000 children in Texas.  In 2014, TSR’s tools were integrated into an innovative online platform known as CLI Engage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, CLI Engage is Texas School Ready! in an integrated online delivery system. It includes TSR’s professional development courses (eCIRCLE), child progress monitoring and reporting tools (CIRCLE Assessment System), supplementary lessons (CIRCLE Activity Collection), and one-to-one, video-based coaching for teachers with the greatest need.  These resources will be available to all Texas school districts, charter schools, and Head Start programs beginning in Fall 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 2014-2015 school year, the Children’s Learning Institute conducted a large-scale pilot of the TSR tools and resources on the CLI Engage platform with Houston ISD, Dallas ISD, and Fort Worth ISD.  More than 2,450 teachers participated in the CLI Engage pilot.

    <h3>What Sets TSR Apart</h3><br />
    <div>
        <p>
           Thousands of pre-K centers in Texas have implemented the Texas School Ready! program since 2003. As TSR has grown, researchers at the Children’s Learning Institute (CLI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center have been collecting incredible amounts of data to track changes in teachers’ instructional practices and advancements in their students’ school readiness skills. The results of this research speak to the innovation and effectiveness of TSR. So, what sets TSR apart from other early childhood interventions?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TSR is the product of ongoing, high quality research that directly informs the program’s implementation.</strong> TSR is the result of ten years of grant-funded work from the US Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Texas Education Agency (TEA), and the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC). This research definitively demonstrates the need for each component of TSR and is continually applied to strengthen on-the-ground components of the program. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TSR matches what a child should master at a certain age with how a child best learns and assimilates information.</strong> TSR strikes a balance between implementing teaching strategies based on research about cognitive readiness (the “what”) and what developmental research indicates about how three- and four-year-olds learn most effectively (the “how”). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TSR is closing the achievement gap.</strong> Research concludes that students who begin the program with the least developed language and literacy skills experience the most dramatic gains. English language learners particularly benefit, as they tend to test below average development initially but have higher rates of improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TSR teachers are incorporating evidence-based practices.</strong> Teachers in TSR show increases in their uses of language-building strategies, including the quality of their book reading, general conversations with children, and the use of oral language instruction to build these skills. Even greater gains have been found in emergent literacy instructional practices including activities that build phonological awareness and print knowledge. Finally, teachers show better responsive teaching practices, organization of their centers, and use of lesson plans. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TSR’s progress monitoring maximizes pre-K education.</strong>  The tool uses benchmarks that indicate what skill levels children should demonstrate based on their individual ages. Digital progress monitoring enables teachers to use concrete data rather than informal observations that are incomplete or significantly less reliable. As a result, students of TSR teachers are receiving highly focused instruction targeted at their least developed skill areas—which means larger academic gains and no wasted time in the classroom.
