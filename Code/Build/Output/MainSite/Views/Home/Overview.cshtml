        The CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System is a standardized,  criterion-referenced measure that relates well to established standardized  tests and is sensitive to growth in children&rsquo;s skills over time. The data used  to support the reliability and validity of the CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System came  from numerous research studies done by the Children&rsquo; Learning Institute over a  five-year span. These research studies were primarily conducted in preschools  and day cares in Texas, Maryland, Ohio, and Florida. For detailed information  about its reliability and validity, please refer to the C-PALLS+ Technical  Manual, available upon request.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to maximize the benefits of student progress  monitoring, we recognize that data reports should be easily accessible, quickly  digestible, and provide multiple perspectives. The CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System&rsquo;s reporting features provide snapshots of student skill levels at the individual,  group, class, school, and even district levels. The reports used clear visual  indicators to flag students who fall below established benchmarks. Finally,  student grouping features and links to recommended activities automatically  provide the teacher with the first steps in beginning small group instruction  that targets specific skill areas.

                <h4>CIRCLE Activity Collection</h4>

            </span>
            <p>The CIRCLE Activity Collection translates the best early childhood development research into practice through a variety of hands-on activities that teachers can implement during large group, small group, centers, and one-on-one instruction. Language, literacy, social emotional skills, mathematics, and science are the core concepts covered in CIRCLE activities. </p>
            <p>The activities incorporate a gradual release model, wherein a teacher models, demonstrates, and “thinks aloud” so that children understand the concepts behind what the teacher is modeling. Children then practice the skills or concepts with the teacher’s guidance.</p>
            <p>The updated collection includes new and expanded activities, videos of select activities performed in real classrooms, and direct links to activities from CLI’s child progress monitoring program, the CIRCLE Progress Monitoring System.</p>

                <h4>Collaboration Tools</h4>
            </span>
            <p>A key component of Texas School Ready! implementation is coaching, which offers an opportunity to provide one-on-one professional development support to teachers in the classroom.  Through CLI Engage, school and district specialists can interact with teachers and provide coaching support.  CLI Engage will include collaboration tools that will enable schools to create coaching plans for teachers, assign professional development to meet a teacher’s individual needs, upload classroom videos, and offer one-on-one feedback, all through one system to track teacher progress.</p>

    <p><strong>Two-Day CIRCLE Training</strong></p>
    <p>The CIRCLE 2-Day Teacher Training is a face-to-face introduction to the foundational, research-based concepts underpinning Texas School Ready! and the CIRCLE line of professional development tools. The goal of the training is to provide a strong knowledge base of early childhood development and quality instructional strategies that support it, so that moving forward teachers feel comfortable exploring eCIRCLE online courses and the CIRCLE Activity Collection on their own.</p>
    <p><strong>Video-based Coaching</strong></p>
    <p>CLI’s approach recognizes that some high-need schools and districts can realize greater child outcomes with individualized, one-to-one teacher coaching. Communicating with teachers via Skype, web-postings, and by phone, trained coaches provide guidance on the teacher’s own recorded instruction. Teachers can review feedback through annotations made directly on their videos as well. Coaches also share other videos of effective teaching and set data-driven goals with the teacher for instructional improvement.</p>
    <p>Video-based coaching increases TSR’s capacity to serve classrooms in communities with limited access to quality improvement opportunities by eliminating the costs associated with travel to remote schools.  With funding from the Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences, TSR recently began a 4-year study to measure the effectiveness of video-based coaching as compared with a traditional face-to-face model.</p>
    <p><strong>Developing Talkers Training</strong></p>
    <p>
        TSR will provide advanced training to teachers in high-need  districts in the Pre-Kindergarten Response to Intervention (P-RTI)  instructional framework and supplemental curriculum, Developing Talkers/Hablemos Juntos. These parallel English and Spanish versions are designed to  meet the needs of many aspects of Tier 1 and Tier 2 pre-K oral language  instruction. Specifically, listening comprehension and vocabulary skills are  targeted in the book reading context by providing lessons, materials, and an  instructional template to develop and strengthen children&rsquo;s oral language  skills.<br />
        Each Developing Talkers Kit includes four units:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introductory Unit</li>
        <li>Unit 1 Binder: All About Me or Todo sobre mí</li>
        <li>Unit 2 Binder: Nature Around Us or Mi mundo</li>
        <li>Unit 3 Binder: Let&rsquo;s Learn About Animals or  Animale</li>
    </ul>
