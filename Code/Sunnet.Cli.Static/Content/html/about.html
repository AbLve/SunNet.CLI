                    CLI Engage is a comprehensive professional development and progress monitoring system for 
                    pre-k teachers in Texas public schools.  Developed by the Children’s Learning Institute at UTHealth and supported with funding from the Texas Education Agency, CLI Engage is available for free to all pre-k teachers in Texas public schools.

                <h3>History of CLI Engage</h3>

                        For over ten years, the Children’s Learning Institute (CLI) in Houston has managed the implementation and ongoing research of the Texas School Ready! (TSR) project—a data-driven, comprehensive professional development (PD) program for pre-K teachers across Texas aimed at increasing school readiness. TSR’s PD and child progress monitoring components have been validated with multiple research studies as proven solutions to improving child outcomes. Soon, this wealth of expertise will be made available to Texas public school teachers, who may not have access to or be in need of TSR’s more customized components, such as facilitated trainings and one-on-one coaching.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Known as Engage, CLI has begun development of this integrated platform to include a body of coursework 
                        representing three years of professional development. The innovation of this coursework is its deep archive of video instruction—from  commentary on child development theories by education researchers and developmental 
                        psychologists, to expert analysis of teacher instruction in real classrooms captured on film.

                        Additionally, Engage will include cutting-edge, online progress monitoring of child outcomes in language and 
                        literacy, science and technology, math, and social and emotional development that can be used to further inform instruction. These two tools are integral to the rationale behind TSR and Engage—to increase the use of specific instructional practices that are known to advance a significant range of academic and social skills in young children, as well as targeting instruction to a child’s least developed skill areas, as measured by real data.

                        CLI conducted a pilot study of CLI Engage during the 2014-2015 school year with five school districts across Texas.  Information collected during this pilot study helped CLI refine the new system for use by teachers.  CLI Engage launched in Fall 2015.
